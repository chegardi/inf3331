# LaTeX preprocessor and compiler
This is the result from a mandatory assignment in INF3331 at University of Oslo Fall2014.

The reason for creating the preprocessor was to increase functionality of LaTeX to comprehend reports about works in programming. As every line the preprocessor handles starts with '%', a regular LaTeX compiler will still manage to handle docuemts written with the preprocess executions, as they are treated as comments in all other cases other than when ran through prepro.py.
The compiler is actually just a method of creating the .pdf document from any LaTeX source code (that preferably have been preprocessed, but it is not necessary). The main feature of the compiler is to reduce the amount of output created by pdflatex to the only information desirable - successful or not.
